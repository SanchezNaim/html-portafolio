     <h2>Summary</h2>
     <p>Greetings from Mexico, my name is Naim as you could see in the tittle above my photo.
     I am sixteen years old, I'm a high school student. I live with my parents and I've got a lovely dog whose name is Bayeleis, just like the lichor ( my dad gave her that name ).
     I've recently uncovered how much I enjoy coding and learning about all this stuff, things related to internet, computers, maths and logic. I said <strong>"uncovered"</strong> because this passion was hidden by myself. I am going to become a full-stack developer and get a job to learn even more, somewhere I heard that we learn more by practicing, in real practice.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I have completed the kinder garden and what the SEP ( Secretary of public education) refers in mexico as
     <strong>"basic education level"</strong> that involves elementary school and secondary school or what is equivalent to seven to nine grade of high school in EU and Canada.</p>
    
    <h4>About my school</h4>
    <p>I'm currently studying in the state of Veracruz the fourth semester of what the SEP refers to <strong>"upper secondary education"</strong>, 
        the equivalent to ten to twelve grade in EU and Canada. The school I am studying at is the 
       <a href="https://www.cetis15.edu.mx/"> <em>CETIS 15</em> </a> 
        (Center of technological, industrial and service studies number 15). The school is a technical one, it means that besides the main subjets you'll have there like maths and physics, you'll also 
        have a main module of one of the actual 5 careers the school offers to the students which are accounting, programming, electriciy, construction and human resources. So, when you
        finish your studies there, besides your certification of the school, you also get a technical degree certification in your module.
    </p>
     
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <p> Although I would have liked to aply for the carrer of programing, I ended up in accounting because by that time I thought it was what i wanted. Now,
        I've realized my mistake and decided to go for the engineer way even though I am in a completely different carrer, I'll try to get the best of each. Sometimes is hard because my carrer requires too much time to get good grades so I redue the time of studying for my dreams a little bit, but I always find a way.
        <br> <br>
        These are my main academic objectives at the cetis15:
        <ul>
            <li>Win the academic competition at a regional level in my currently school</li>
            <li>Be the first person to win the prototypes competition being an accounting student (Commonly only the students from programming and electriciy modules join this competition but is open to everyone)</li>
            <li>Get a perfect final degree of 10 in fourth semester and a </li>
            <li>Finish my studies with a degree above 9 </li>
            <li>Get my accounting technical degree at the end of my studies</li>
        </ul>

        <br> 
        Besides, I want to get a scholarship at the University of toronto to study software engineering there.

    </p>

    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <P>I have absolutely no working experience, that is one of the main reasons why I am learning to program. I hope to
        work as an intern whether for free or having economic remuneration, the idea is get experience in the real work enviroment.
